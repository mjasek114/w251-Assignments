*********************
• If you have a large set of data to copy, it might help to use all
cluster nodes to share ingest workload. Use a write-affinity
depth of 0, along with as many cluster nodes with storage as
possible to copy data in parallel.
A write-affinity depth of 0 ensures that each node
distributes data across as many nodes as possible. GPFS
policies can be used to enforce write-affinity depth settings
based on fileset name, filename or other attributes.
